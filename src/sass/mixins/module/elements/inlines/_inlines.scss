// Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure or style of a word, line or portion of text.

// Element  | Description
// <a>      | The HTML <a> Element (or the HTML Anchor Element) defines a hyperlink,
//            the named target destination for a hyperlink, or both.

// <abbr>   | The HTML Abbreviation element (<abbr>) represents an abbreviation and optionally provides a full description for it.
//            If present, the title attribute must contain this full description and nothing else.

// <b>      | The HTML <b> Element represents a span of text stylistically different from normal text,
//            without conveying any special importance or relevance.
//            It is typically used for keywords in a summary, product names in a review,
//            or other spans of text whose typical presentation would be boldfaced.
//            Another example, of its use is to mark the lead sentence of each paragraph of an article.

// <br>     | The HTML <br> Element (or HTML Line Break Element) produces a line break in text (carriage-return).
//            It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
